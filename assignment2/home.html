                <p>The visualisations below use the data reported by the "World Happiness Report". The Happiness Score
                    is based on the Gallup World Poll (GWP), which asks the main life evaluation questions. Following
                    the poll,
                    the scores are computed by averaging the responses to those questions. The GWP uses the Cantril
                    Ladder.</p>

                This choropleth map uses continuous color encoding to inscripe the happpiness score of each
                country. A lower score is associated with a lifgter color, while a higher score is associated with a darker
                color. For the countries in grey there was no data collected.

            <h3>Locations</h3>
            <p> 153 out of 195 countries were considered. Furthermore, these countries defined 10 regional indicators: Central and Eastern Europe,
                Commonwealth of Independent States, East Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America and ANZ, South Asia, Southeast Asia,
                Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe,

            <p>In order to understand what defines the happiness of each country,
                it is relevant to inspect factors that could influence it. For instance, economic production, social
                support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.

                <h3>Economic Situation and Generosity</h3>
                    <p>A factor that could imapact happiness is the economic situation of an individual. The GDP per capita
                        indirectly indicates the income of an average individual. Interestingly, 
                        the bubble chart displays that countries with higher GDP per capita appeared to be happier. Generosity is represented 
                        by the bubble size and it does not appear to be a significant influencer.

            <div class="p2">
                <h3>Governamental Social Support</h3>
                    <p>The social support offered by the government can be another factor thats imapacts happiness. 
                        This support can range from governamental aid for people suffering financially to maternity leave rights and 
                        education funding. As seen in the scatter plot, countries with more social support tend to be happier.
                    </p>

        </div>

        <br>

        <div class="ps"></div>
            <p>
                Given that the "World Happiness Report" presents the scores for all the countries and regional indicators,
                a ranking for each can be presented.

            <h3>Regional</h3>
            <p> 
                Consistent with the other charts, "North Amrica and ANZ" and "Wester Europe" apppear to 
                have the countries with the happiest people. While "South Asia" and "Sub-Saharan Africa" are among the last.
                Although, the factors presented could play a part in this ranking, there might me other reasons for he order of this rank.

            <p>
                Consistents with the other charts and the regional ranking, countries from the 
                "North Amrica and ANZ" and "Wester Europe" regions are shown to have the happiest people.
                These coutries also were the ones who had the highest GDP per capita and governamental social support.
